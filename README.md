# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

In this Follow Along project, we will be a building a Ecommerce Application that is built using MERN Stack.
It uses REST API to allow connection between the client and the server so that the user will be able to sign up and then login using their personal credentials.
It has active product management and also handles orders.   
It uses Mongo DB to store the data and then do various tasks that the user want to perform.
Manage customer orders. Each API endpoint will interact with the database and serve data in a structured format (typically JSON). User Authentication: Register and log in users. Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data. Order Handling: Manage customer orders. Each API endpoint will interact with the database and serve data in a structured format


### Milestone 1: Project Overview


The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application

Mongo DB is used instead of SQL so that a large amount of data can be stored without storing them in the structured format.

We use REST API to handle the client and the server connection.


### Milestone 2: Project Setup

In this milestone, we created a login page using react and tailwind css. Then we linked it to the app.jsx using a loginPage.jsx in the pages folder.
Here, we learned about the differences between css and tailwind css and how to use it effectively.
